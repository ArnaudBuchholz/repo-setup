# My repositories

On my personal GitHub (https://github.com/arnaudbuchholz), there are more than 100 repositories with 70+ of them being original.
The ones which are prefixed with `training-` contain examples or training material.

The following list highlights the projects which can be looked upon as representative of my work.

## `md2word` 

> Markdown to word automation

When I wrote the Clean UI5 book (https://www.sap-press.com/clean-sapui5_5479/), I was working with 5 other authors.
We wanted to make sure that we all respect the same guidelines and our samples were validated.
I decided to write this tool to have all of use the same syntax (markdown) and added validation on top of it (not only markdown but also examples).
Then, I wrote this tool to leverage the publisher template and convert the markdown files into Word documents.

## `minecraft`



## `bubu-timer`
